superj
======
The most powerful, fastest javascript framework ever written.

_*Details*_
superj is the speeding bullet of javascript frameworks, able to jump over tall buildings, save the day, and of course, make creating super awesomeness out of the box.

_*Extensibility*_ - superj was created with extensibility in mind. It plays nice with every other framework and makes no assumptions. There are no conventions, it is up to you, dear reader, to unleash your potential.

_*Getting started*_ - Include a link to the script 'superjs.min.js' and you're on you way to make the web a better place for all.

_*Key features*_

*Extensibility*
it just has that boiler teeming over.
_*Speed*_
as fast as native javascript (faster in some browsers due to limitations of the js engines - not doubt being diligently worked on every day by the slower interpreters (I'm looking at your IE))
